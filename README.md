# Component Detection for Product Assembly in Manufacturing Using Deep Learning (YOLOv5)

This project focuses on developing a deep learning–based object detection model using **YOLOv5** to identify manufacturing components such as:

- Arduino Board  
- Arduino Nano  
- Printed Circuit Board (PCB)

The project was developed as part of the Final Year Project (FYP) for the Bachelor of Electrical Engineering (Mechatronics) at **Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)**.
