Component Detection for Product Assembly in Manufacturing using YOLOv5

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based component detection system developed for my Final Year Project at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).
The model is built using YOLOv5 to detect three product assembly components:
	•	Arduino UNO
	•	PCB board
	•	Arduino Nano

The goal is to perform component detection within one second for manufacturing environments such as Flex, improving accuracy, automation, and production efficiency.

🚀 Project Highlights
	•	Built using YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)
	•	Annotated 50+ images using MakeSense.ai
	•	Trained using Google Colab GPU
	•	Achieved mAP@0.5 = 0.995
	•	High precision, high recall, but some false positives due to background similarity
	•	Includes loss curves, PR curves, confusion matrix
